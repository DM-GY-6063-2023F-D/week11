## [analogWrite-00](./analogWrite-00/)
Turns on 3 LEDs with 3 different voltage levels.

## [analogWrite-01-fadeIn](./analogWrite-01-fadeIn/)
Fade-in one LED from 0 to full voltage, having it reset to 0 once it gets to full voltage.

## [analogWrite-02-fadeInOut](./analogWrite-02-fadeInOut/)
Fade one LED in and out, from 0 to full voltage and then back to 0 gradually.
